# Welcome to the Oregon Trail Adventure!

### Story

A widow decides that Kansas City harbors too many memories of her beloved departed husband, and, in order to move on, must leave and start anew with her young daughter. At church, she overhears talk of a second wave of people leaving in 3 weeks for the wide open spaces of the Western Territories. This is EXACTLY the change she's needing to make in her life, so she heads home to pack up, sells her home to purchase a covered wagon, 2 mules, food and supplies for the trip.

The scene begins in Independence, Missouri, where she meets up with the wagon train to set off towards a new life. They travel through 4 States during this adventure; Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and finally settling in Oregon City, Oregon.

The young widow must navigate across swift rivers, come across potentially hostile Natives, avoid starvation and deadly disease, and cross seemingly impossible mountainous terrain before he can reach her destination. Making the right decisions in every situation is vital for survival. One wrong decision and her family can perish! It is a risky and exhausting journey. Can you guide them safely to Oregon?

<!-- SECTION The first room/State you enter -->
- Nebraska
"Going Westward, halfway across the plains, a wheel falls apart and you are separated from the wagon train. A group of Natives are spotted to the North approaching your newly-repaired wagon. If you are to get out of this situation alive, you must find something of value to offer them, or attempt to escape. Choose your direction."

<!-- SECTION Halfway point! -->
- Wyoming
	"Your family is hungry. Where can you go to find more food supplies? Choose your direction."
		

<!-- SECTION Nearly there!-->
- Idaho
"You're only 8 days away from your destination, but you reach a deep and swift river. Do you try and cross? Or do you try a different way? Choose your direction."

<!-- SECTION Final leg of the journey. Don't give up now! -->
- Oregon
"You're almost there! You've reached a daunting mountain pass that you must cross before you make it to your new home. Which direction will you take?"
